"""what is a variable in Python?"""

"""variables in Python have no commands unlike JS, they don't need to be declared, 
the value is assigned when you create it, In Python, variables are named containers used to store and manage data during program execution.
 They act like boxes or labels that hold values you can work with within your code"""
