// SCENARIO - you have a website where there are some articles/posts.
// You want to ask the user to SIGN-UP after 20 seconds.
// However, if the user has already clicked on the
// subscribe button WITHIN 20 seconds,
// then there is NO point in running the logic (asking them to subscribe).

// TASK - BUILD THE FOLLOWING INSIDE A FUNCTION:
// if (time>=20 seconds) and the user has subscribed (boolean) && (&& = and operator)
// clearTimeOut
// else the user has NOT subscribed
// setTimeOut (20000) //20 seconds

function subscribe() {
    console.log('Hiya!')

}

if subscribe(2000 >=)
